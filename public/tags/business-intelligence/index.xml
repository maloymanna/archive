The talk focused more on changes in digital technology disrupting businesses, the effect of Big Data, the FOMO (Fear of missing out) effect on big business - and what it meant for changes to the way we do business intelligence in the digital era.
 Key themes:
 Disruption in traditional IT with cloud computing Changing economics and changing business models Rise of Big Data Tech changes to manage Big Data - distributed computing Shift from &amp;ldquo;current-state&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;next-state&amp;rdquo; questions Introducing Data Science Challenges - regulatory, data privacy Dangers of data science - over-fitting, interpretation Managing big data projects Data Science MOOCs (massive open online courses), tools and resources</description>
