      <description>I recently gave a talk on data processing with Apache Spark using R and Python. tl;dr - the slides and presentation can be accessed below (free registration):
   As noted in my previous post, Spark has become the defacto standard for big data applications and has been adopted quickly by the industry. See Cloudera&amp;rsquo;s One Platform initiative blog post by CEO Mike Olson for their commitment to Spark.</description>

      <description>I presented a talk last week introducing Data Science and associated topics to some enthusiasts.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a slide deck I created quickly with markdown using Swipe - a start-up building HTML5 presentation tools.
The contents include:
 Data scientist skills Data science: enablers and barriers Big data analytics Data science lifecycle Use cases Tools and technology Project approach Machine learning Skills and roles Learning resources  Here are the slides:</description>

      <description>Sometime back I presented a webinar on BrightTalk. The slides for the talk have now been uploaded on Slideshare. The talk focused more on changes in digital technology disrupting businesses, the effect of Big Data, the FOMO (Fear of missing out) effect on big business - and what it meant for changes to the way we do business intelligence in the digital era.
 Key themes:
 Disruption in traditional IT with cloud computing Changing economics and changing business models Rise of Big Data Tech changes to manage Big Data - distributed computing Shift from &amp;ldquo;current-state&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;next-state&amp;rdquo; questions Introducing Data Science Challenges - regulatory, data privacy Dangers of data science - over-fitting, interpretation Managing big data projects Data Science MOOCs (massive open online courses), tools and resources</description>

      <description>This is the 3rd part of a series of posts on Big Data. Read Part-1 (What is Big Data) and Part-2 (Hadoop).
Traditionally data warehouses have been built with relational databases as backbone. With the new challenges (3Vs) of Big Data, relational databases have been falling short of the requirements of handling
 New data types (unstructured data) Extended analytic processing Throughput (TB/hour loading) with immediate query access  The industry has turned to Hadoop as a disruptive solution for these very challenges.</description>

      <description>As discussed in Part 1 of this series, Hadoop is the foremost among tools being currently used for deriving value out of Big Data. The process of gaining insights from data through Business Intelligence and analytics essentially remains the same. However, with the huge variety, volume and velocity (the 3Vs of Big Data), it’s become necessary to re-think of the data management infrastructure. Hadoop, originally designed to be used with the MapReduce algorithm to solve parallel processing constraints in distributed architectures (e.</description>

      <description>You can’t miss all the buzz about Big Data! Over the past few years, the buzz around the cloud and Big Data shaping most of the future of computing, IT and analytics in particular has grown incessantly strong. As with most buzz words, which are then hijacked by marketing to suit their own products’ storylines, but which nonetheless manage to confuse users in business and staff in IT as well, Big Data means several things to several people.</description>
