      <description>With each of the big 3 Hadoop vendors - Cloudera, Hortonworks and MapR each providing their own Hadoop sandbox virtual machines (VMs), trying out Hadoop today has become extremely easy. For a developer, it is extremely useful to download a get started with one of these VMs and try out Hadoop to practiceÂ data science right away.
However, with the core Apache Hadoop, these vendors package their own software into their distributions, mostly for the orchestration and management, which can be a pain due to the multiple scattered open-source projects within the Hadoop ecosystem.</description>
