      <description>Eric Ries, a young American entrepreneur and ex-software engineer published &amp;ldquo;The Lean Startup&amp;rdquo; in 2011. The book is the collective wisdom of the valley and smart folks like Ries and Steve Blank about the purpose of a startup and the methods that help with it most efficiently. It&amp;rsquo;s because of the explosion of interest in the lean-startup methods that today concepts like &amp;ldquo;fail-fast&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;MVP&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;pivot&amp;rdquo; are commonplace. Coupled with lean-concepts and the experimentation afforded by agile methods, the lean-startup techniques improves the chances of success of a startup.</description>

Due to its inception in the quality and productivity improvement processes in Japanese manufacturing, especially the Toyota Production System, the three main categories of waste (3M) have Japanese names: muda, mura and muri .
 Muda - any activity that consumes resources but creates no value for the customer</description>

      <description>The use of lean practices like Kanban boards has become really popular in project management, especially those using agile methods. But what exactly is Lean project management ?
