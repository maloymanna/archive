      <description>SAP BI 4.0 release (codenamed Aurora) has been the first major release of the BI platform since SAP acquired BusinessObjects. In this release, the semantic layer (universe layer for the uninitiated) has been re-worked completely to expose all business data under a single umbrella. The self-service BI portal (aka Infoview) has been revamped with a new AJAX based design and providing quicker and easier access to content. Publishing and distribution of BI content to mass audience has been made easier.</description>

      <description>SAP finally announced on September 14, 2010 that it was getting onto the pre-packaged analytics bandwagon. SAP announced ten applications in this first release for six industries (Consumer Products, Healthcare, Financial Services, Public Sector, Retail and Telecommunications) in its BusinessObjects offering.
Building on the rapid-marts offering that the then BOBJ used to have and leveraging SAP’s industry and line of business expertise, these new applications are based on the SAP Business Objects XI platform – WebIntelligence, Crystal Reports and Dashboards (formerly Xcelsius).</description>

      <description>With BO XI 3.1 SP2 out in July this year, it is probably time to make a trip down the years to find out how the XI platform has evolved and matured.
The timeline:
 XI R2 SP2 - service pack release in March 2007 with productivity pack - QaaWS and LiveOffice connectors
 XI 3.0 - new major release in February 2008 - the first release after SAP acquired BOBJ in October 2007</description>

      <title>Developing a Business Objects security model - BO XI 3.1</title>

      <description>While developing a Business Objects security model, you need to focus on the different types of security:
Functional Security - this would govern access to specific application features, e.g. editing reports, drilling down, ability to schedule reports etc.
Data Security - this governs access to specific data - rows or columns or cells as per authorization
Infrastructure Security - governs physical and electronic access to systems
The infrastructure security is the first to be designed.</description>

      <title>Change the location Google Desktop Search indexes your data</title>

      <description>Desktop search has become an important component of our everyday work. With the amount of information explosion, it is only natural that users and enterprises move towards enabling desktop (and enterprise) search for users – subject of course to appropriate security and access controls. BI vendors have moved into this new business space that has opened up and seems to be one of the most promising. While Business Objects had announced support for the Google Search appliance and Google Desktop back in 2006, their most important announcement lately has been the launch of the Business Objects Explorer (formerly known as Polestar) product.</description>
