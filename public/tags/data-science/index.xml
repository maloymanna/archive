      <description>I recently gave a talk on data processing with Apache Spark using R and Python. tl;dr - the slides and presentation can be accessed below:

As noted in my previous post, Spark has become the defacto standard for big data applications and has been adopted quickly by the industry. See Cloudera&amp;rsquo;s One Platform initiative blog post by CEO Mike Olson for their commitment to Spark.
In data science R had seen rapid adoption, not only because it was open source and free compared to costly SAS, but also the huge number of statistical and graphical packages provided by R for data science.</description>

      <description>I presented a talk last week introducing Data Science and associated topics to some enthusiasts. Here&amp;rsquo;s a slide deck I created quickly with markdown using Swipe - a start-up building HTML5 presentation tools. Here are the slides: https://www.swipe.to/2675ch</description>
