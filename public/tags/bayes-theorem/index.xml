      <description>Probability concepts form the foundation for statistics.

A formal definition of probability: The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an inÔ¨Ånite number of times. This is a corollary of the law of large numbers: As more observations are collected, the proportion of occurrences with a particular outcome converges to the probability of that outcome.
Disjoint (mutually exclusive) events as events that cannot both happen at the same time.</description>
