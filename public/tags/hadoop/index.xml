      <description>I recently gave a talk on data processing with Apache Spark using R and Python. tl;dr - the slides and presentation can be accessed below (free registration):
   As noted in my previous post, Spark has become the defacto standard for big data applications and has been adopted quickly by the industry. See Cloudera&amp;rsquo;s One Platform initiative blog post by CEO Mike Olson for their commitment to Spark.</description>

      <description>Apache Spark has created a lot of buzz recently. In fact, beyond the buzz, Apache Spark has seen phenomenal adoption and has been marked out as the successor to Hadoop MapReduce.
Google Trends confirms the hockey stick like growth in interest in Apache Spark. All leading Hadoop vendors, including Cloudera, now include Apache Spark in their Hadoop distribution.
So what exactly is Spark, and why has it generated such enthusiasm? Apache Spark is an open-source big data processing framework designed for speed and ease of use.</description>

      <description>With each of the big 3 Hadoop vendors - Cloudera, Hortonworks and MapR each providing their own Hadoop sandbox virtual machines (VMs), trying out Hadoop today has become extremely easy. For a developer, it is extremely useful to download a get started with one of these VMs and try out Hadoop to practice data science right away.
However, with the core Apache Hadoop, these vendors package their own software into their distributions, mostly for the orchestration and management, which can be a pain due to the multiple scattered open-source projects within the Hadoop ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Basics of Big Data - Building a Hadoop data warehouse</title>

      <description>This is the 3rd part of a series of posts on Big Data. Read Part-1 (What is Big Data) and Part-2 (Hadoop).
Traditionally data warehouses have been built with relational databases as backbone. With the new challenges (3Vs) of Big Data, relational databases have been falling short of the requirements of handling
 New data types (unstructured data) Extended analytic processing Throughput (TB/hour loading) with immediate query access  The industry has turned to Hadoop as a disruptive solution for these very challenges.</description>

      <description>As discussed in Part 1 of this series, Hadoop is the foremost among tools being currently used for deriving value out of Big Data. The process of gaining insights from data through Business Intelligence and analytics essentially remains the same. However, with the huge variety, volume and velocity (the 3Vs of Big Data), it’s become necessary to re-think of the data management infrastructure. Hadoop, originally designed to be used with the MapReduce algorithm to solve parallel processing constraints in distributed architectures (e.</description>

      <description>You can’t miss all the buzz about Big Data! Over the past few years, the buzz around the cloud and Big Data shaping most of the future of computing, IT and analytics in particular has grown incessantly strong. As with most buzz words, which are then hijacked by marketing to suit their own products’ storylines, but which nonetheless manage to confuse users in business and staff in IT as well, Big Data means several things to several people.</description>

      <title>Review of the BT Summit – Cloud computing, SOA and BI tracks</title>

      <description>I attended the Business Technology Summit in Bangalore last week – 3rd and 4th November. There were 3 tracks on cloud computing, Service Oriented Architecture and Business Intelligence, and I chose a mix of sessions across each.
Overall impression:The BT Summit was heavily focused on cloud computing with half of second day having a deep dive into Amazon’s EC2 cloud offering, and several keynotes. SOA and web services, REST and similar architectural sessions were interspersed but definitely not a first-class citizen.</description>
