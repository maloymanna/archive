      <description>SAP BI 4.0 release (codenamed Aurora) has been the first major release of the BI platform since SAP acquired BusinessObjects. In this release, the semantic layer (universe layer for the uninitiated) has been re-worked completely to expose all business data under a single umbrella. The self-service BI portal (aka Infoview) has been revamped with a new AJAX based design and providing quicker and easier access to content. Publishing and distribution of BI content to mass audience has been made easier.</description>

      <description>With BO XI 3.1 SP2 out in July this year, it is probably time to make a trip down the years to find out how the XI platform has evolved and matured.
The timeline:
 XI R2 SP2 - service pack release in March 2007 with productivity pack - QaaWS and LiveOffice connectors
 XI 3.0 - new major release in February 2008 - the first release after SAP acquired BOBJ in October 2007</description>

      <description>While developing a Business Objects security model, you need to focus on the different types of security:
Functional Security - this would govern access to specific application features, e.g. editing reports, drilling down, ability to schedule reports etc.
Data Security - this governs access to specific data - rows or columns or cells as per authorization
Infrastructure Security - governs physical and electronic access to systems
The infrastructure security is the first to be designed.</description>
